This is a Library for Python that Converts Gmail Card Data (Currently only JSON-LD, not Microdata) into Editable and Human-Readable Data.
More Info about Schemas (Google Cards) here: https://developers.google.com/gmail/schemas/reference/index



Enjoy!



( All the code you need to use/modify is under the if __name__ == '__main__' part. )






* Please note that this code hasn't been yet tested on Actual Emails with Gmail Cards. But works perfectly with all the samples from the Google Developers Website.

* But if an E-Mail (in Plain Text) has the appropriate Code, like in Google Developers, it is rendered Successfully!


	Thanks.
